    <p>Also known to a friend as Jewell Cake, named after her mother, this cake is a tower of moist cake layers with icing and is no easy feat to take on! However, this recipe helps simplify it a bit!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix (such as Duncan Hines®)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 egg whites</li>
        <li>1(3.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) box confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 5 8-inch cake pans, and line them with parchment paper.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Whisk together the cake mix, baking powder, flour, and sugar in a large mixing bowl. With an electric mixer, beat the mixture with water, vegetable oil, and egg whites at low speed until thoroughly mixed; increase speed to medium, and beat 2 minutes. Scoop 1 cup of batter into each of the 5 prepared cake pans.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cakes are set in the middle, about 8 minutes; watch carefully so the thin cakes don't burn. Cool in pans for 10 minutes, then remove to wire racks to finish cooling.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Whisk the chocolate pudding mix with 2 cups of milk in a bowl until thoroughly blended; let stand 2 minutes to thicken. Place a cake layer on a serving dish, and spread with about 1/2 cup of pudding; repeat with remaining layers and pudding, ending with a cake layer.</p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>In a bowl, mash the cream cheese and butter together until thoroughly combined; mix in confectioners' sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, and milk, slowly adding and mixing in milk as needed to make a spreadable frosting. Ice the top and sides of the cake with the frosting. Refrigerate leftovers.</p>
